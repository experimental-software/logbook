# Logbook [![Stability: Experimental](https://masterminds.github.io/stability/experimental.svg)](https://masterminds.github.io/stability/experimental.html)

The Logbook project provides a command-line application for Markdown-based chronological note-taking.

## Usage

Provided that a computer has the SDK for the [go](https://go.dev) programming language installed, the _Logbook_ can be
installed by cloning its git repository and then running the `go install` command.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:experimental-software/logbook.git && cd ./logbook
go install
```

Then the program can be executed with the `logbook2` command:

```sh
logbook2
```

## Development

go run main.go
```

## Maintenance
