# Quality Requirements

## Simplicity

The scope of the tool should be to create log entries. Advanced features (e.g. file templates or encryption) should be done with complementary tools.

## Robostness

Eventually there should be zero defects. All edge cases should be handled gracefully.

## Maintainability

The code should be clear to understand and well tested, so that the project can be maintained for the long term.
